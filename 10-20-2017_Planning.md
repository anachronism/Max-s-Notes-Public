# 10/20/2017 Planning SessionBetter Time Management

## TL;DR:
### Time Schedule:
* Monday: STR
* Tuesday: STR
* Wednesday: STR/Watch Machine Vision class lectures
* Thursday: Worcester, Machine Vision Homework + NASA stuff.
* Friday: Home/Boston, NASA stuff.
* Saturday/Sunday: Free, probably do work at some point, photography + music.
### General notes:
* Play the vidya games, but not too much. No more than twice in the workday.
* Watch a lot less YouTube, mainly in the morning but also at night.
    * Probably less than an hour a day.
* You’re going to want to at least make a to-do list at the beginning of each week, it’ll give you an opportunity to have at least some foresight into what you’re doing, instead of jumping into it regularly.
  
 
## Main Section
So you’ve been pretty trash at time management outside of work. So take this opportunity to get better at it. 

You’ve got a handful of different things you should be doing. 
Need to do:
* Work on Machine Vision class.
    * Watch lectures.
    * Start assignments a lot earlier.
* Work on Master’s Thesis w/ NASA
    * Look into GANs
    * Email Paffenroff to set up a meeting.
    * Take a closer look at the code.
* Work for STR.
    * Look into the clock variance issue.
Want to do:
* Take photos
    * Film
        * Nimslo/nishika 
            * Probably needs to be a with people thing, as people are usually the best subject.
        * MJU
            * Not much to say on this one, keep on using it when you see fit.
        * Ricoh KR Super
            * Need to take out on purpose. It’s still rated at 1600, remember there’s the ND filter though so it still shoots as 400 I think.
        * 120 Folder.
            * 4 shots left in this roll, just try to get it out so you can finally see it.
    * Digital
        * Not much to say here either. So maybe this’ll be where I can talk about overall projects.
        * I like the idea of taking photos places where they would potentially be boring? Like boring things framed well idk
        * More portraits, but that depends on more portrait subjects.
    * Video
        * Download resolve or premiere lol.
        * Probably have footage from Germany + Hong Kong way back. 
* Make music.
    * Inspired by Ta-ku
        * hearwhatyousee or whatever it’s called.
        * Maybe take photos based on music, and vice versa.
    * Just do sketches.
* Hang out
* Exercise/Work out
    * Either convince the parents to get a rowing machine, or get a gym membership of some sort, or just start using what’s at home at first probably.
What you’ve been doing but should probably cut down on:
* Watching a lot of YouTube

You’ve fallen off a little bit on the class, and it shows with your recent grades.
Can probably assume Monday-Wednesday will be STR days, with Wednesday being 4 hours. Especially since you’re not going to be taking nearly as many measurements as you did this Wednesday. Second half of Wednesday should be spent watching the class lectures. Thursday, for the foreseeable future, will be in Worcester. This should be split between lab work and Machine Vision class work. Probably get around to finishing the coursera at this time as well. Friday is the free day, but you almost definitely do not want to treat it the way you have been. It should probably be a full thesis day, as much as possible. You have a hard time working at home, so maybe get into the habit of finding somewhere else you can work. Thesis stuff is maybe a bit difficult to do on the iPad, so maybe either work with the work laptop, or work on your desktop, and just figure out how to make home a better working environment. Might be a club-closet kinda deal if you have to. You can kinda program on the iPad, and evidently you can make basic latex documents, so yeah. 

Maybe, it’d actually be better to take these notes in Git, at least so I can view it on other devices, as I’m not really synced up with this. Or maybe use Evernote? I think Evernote may be the easier solution. 

I think I need to check in with myself more regularly, and it may help this whole weird feeling. I will try using Github probably.
