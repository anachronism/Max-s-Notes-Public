abstract = "We apply coset codes to adaptive modulation in fading channels. Adaptive modulation is a powerful technique to improve the energy efficiency and increase the data rate over a fading channel. Coset codes are a natural choice to use with adaptive modulation since the channel coding and modulation designs are separable. Therefore, trellis and lattice codes designed for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels can be superimposed on adaptive modulation for fading channels, with the same approximate coding gains. We first describe the methodology for combining coset codes with a general class of adaptive modulation techniques. We then apply this methodology to a spectrally efficient adaptive M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) to obtain trellis-coded adaptive MQAM. We present analytical and simulation results for this design which show an effective coding gain of 3 dB relative to uncoded adaptive MQAM for a simple four-state trellis code, and an effective 3.6-dB coding gain for an eight-state trellis code. More complex trellis codes are shown to achieve higher gains. We also compare the performance of trellis-coded adaptive MQAM to that of coded modulation with built-in time diversity and fixed-rate modulation. The adaptive method exhibits a power savings of up to 20 dB.",

abstract = "In the last years we are seeing the increasing presence of multimedia applications together with a wide variety of terminals, from the PCs to the notebooks, from the smartphones to the tablets. In order to exploit such advanced services, ubiquitous and broadband connections are required. While urban or suburban areas can be covered by using terrestrial wireless broadband networks, there are several rural or low populated areas with narrowband access. To this aim, satellite community has developed in the last years two communications standards specifically suited for mobile communications, i.e., DVB-SH and DVB-RCS NG. Among others they consider adaptive waveforms techniques for increasing the system reliability and throughput aiming to exploit the variable channel behavior. Adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) belongs to this family of algorithms, by adapting the modulation and coding scheme based on the channel behavior. In this paper we focus on a state adaptive algorithm suited for mobile applications.",

The FEC implementation switches on the fly during a connection between several FEC and modulation modes to guarantee a maximum ATM cell error rate of 10/sup -6/. In order to prevent influences of the changing FEC scheme on the user-level data rate, the MAC dynamically changes its packet lengths. Additionally, to minimize contention on the up-link, the MAC structures its TDMA frame into a fixed assigned part and a contention specific part. The boarder in between the two is dynamically altered according to the current link utilization.",

abstract = "The cognitive radio (CR) paradigm for designing next‐generation wireless communications systems is becoming increasingly popular, and different aspects of it are being implemented in currently available wireless systems. In the last decade, a significant amount of research efforts has been made to solve CR challenges, and several standards related to CR and dynamic spectrum access have been developed. Also, there have been advances in software‐defined radio platforms to implement the CR systems. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the evolution of CR research covering aspects such as spectrum sensing, measurements and statistical modeling of spectrum usage, physical layer aspects such as waveform and modulation design, multiple access, resource allocation and power control, cognitive learning, adaptation and self‐configuration, multihop transmission and routing, and robustness and security in CR networks. Also, state‐of‐the‐art research on the economics of CR networks, CR simulation tools, testbeds and hardware prototypes, CR applications, and CR standardization efforts is summarized.

To realize this diverse set of applications, CR researchers leverage a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To help researchers better understand the practical implications of AI to their CR designs, this paper reviews several CR implementations that used the following AI techniques: artificial neural networks (ANNs), metaheuristic algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMMs), rule-based systems, ontology-based systems (OBSs), and case-based systems (CBSs). Factors that influence the choice of AI techniques, such as responsiveness, complexity, security, robustness, and stability, are discussed. To provide readers with a more concrete understanding, these factors are illustrated in an extended discussion of two CR designs.",

We review various learning problems that have been studied in the context of CRs classifying them under two main categories: Decision-making and feature classification. Decision-making is responsible for determining policies and decision rules for CRs while feature classification permits identifying and classifying different observation models. The learning algorithms encountered are categorized as either supervised or unsupervised algorithms. We describe in detail several challenging learning issues that arise in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), in particular in non-Markovian environments and decentralized networks, and present possible solution methods to address them.

abstract = "In this work we investigate an auction mechanism for sharing available wireless bandwidth among competing cognitive radios. The bandwidth under consideration may be either in an unlicensed spectrum or in an unused licensed band. Spectrum sharing is achieved via a mechanism in which a cognitive radio acting as the auctioneer advertises spectrum availability to bidding cognitive radios and defines a puzzle to solve as a method to access it. The cognitive radios act as bidders by computing the solution to the problem (i.e., the &#x201C;puzzle&#x201D;). The winner is the bidder who submits the first correct bid and thus gains access to the spectrum for the next time interval. We consider two different variances of our scheme based on parallelizable and non-parallelizable problems and demonstrate that the latter provides a fair auction in contrast to the former. We propose a verification database to counter malicious &#x201C;greedy&#x201D; players. Our algorithm provides a centralized, easy-to-implement, and computationally fast multiple-access scheme that is verifiable by all participating cognitive radios.",

After three years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researchers, Watson is performing at human expert levels in terms of precision, confidence, and speed at the Jeopardy quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that can be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating, and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of question answering (QA).

Primarily, this is due to the explosion in the availability of data, significant improvements in ML techniques, and advancement in computing capabilities. Undoubtedly, ML has been applied to various mundane and complex problems arising in network operation and management. There are various surveys on ML for specific areas in networking or for specific network technologies. This survey is original, since it jointly presents the application of diverse ML techniques in various key areas of networking across different network technologies. In this way, readers will benefit from a comprehensive discussion on the different learning paradigms and ML techniques applied to fundamental problems in networking, including traffic prediction, routing and classification, congestion control, resource and fault management, QoS and QoE management, and network security. Furthermore, this survey delineates the limitations, give insights, research challenges and future opportunities to advance ML in networking.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

In the off-line training, the LM method is regarded as an intermediate method between the steepest descent (SD) and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods, and it has better convergence properties than the other two methods. In the echo cancellation experiments, the recursive LM algorithm converges faster and gives higher echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) than the recursive SD and GN algorithms.",

@article{empericalCatForget,
	abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting is a problem faced by many machine learning models and algorithms. When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models "forget" how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithm--the dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.},

They achieve this by deriving backpropagation signals through a competitive process involving a pair of networks. The representations that can be learned by GANs may be used in a variety of applications, including image synthesis, semantic image editing, style transfer, image superresolution, and classification. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of GANs for the signal processing community, drawing on familiar analogies and concepts where possible. In addition to identifying different methods for training and constructing GANs, we also point to remaining challenges in their theory and application.},

@inproceedings{learnNseIntro,
	abstract = "We have recently introduced an incremental learning algorithm, called Learn++.NSE, designed for Non-Stationary Environments (concept drift), where the underlying data distribution changes over time. With each dataset drawn from a new environment, Learn++.NSE generates a new classifier to form an ensemble of classifiers. The ensemble members are combined through a dynamically weighted majority voting, where voting weights are determined based on classifiers' age-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. Unlike other ensemble-based concept drift algorithms, Learn++.NSE does not discard prior classifiers, allowing potentially cyclical environments to be learned more effectively. While Learn++.NSE has been shown to work well on a variety of concept drift problems, a potential shortcoming of this approach is the cumulative nature of the ensemble size. In this contribution, we expand our analysis of the algorithm to include various ensemble pruning methods to introduce controlled forgetting. Error or age-based pruning methods have been integrated into the algorithm to prevent potential out-voting from irrelevant classifiers or simply to save memory over an extended period of time. Here, we analyze the tradeoff between these precautions and the desire to handle recurring contexts (cyclical data). Comparisons are made using several scenarios that introduce various types of drift.",

Although ACM was originally designed for optimizing unicast services, this article discusses the expansion of its usage to broadcasting streams as well. For this purpose, a general cross-layer adaptation approach is proposed, along with its realization into a fully functional experimental network, and test results are presented. Finally, two case studies are analysed, assessing the gain derived by ACM in a real large-scale deployment, involving HD services provision to two different geographical areas.</p>",
