\par Here is where I will talk about what I have accomplished.
\section{Simulation results, MATLAB}
\par MATLAB was initially used in developing the modified CEs, both with the RLM training method and the NSE training method. As such, the SNR profile that was used in testing was a simple slow-fading channel. A plot of the SNR profile is shown in Figure \ref{fig:matlabSNRProf}.

Explain what evaluation method we're using. \\
Then show results.
