\section{Simulation results, MATLAB}
\par MATLAB was initially used in developing the modified CEs, both with the RLM training method and the NSE training method. The intent of the MATLAB simulation was to verify the potential benefit of both changes to the CE, in an environment where implementing iterational modifications is as frictionless as possible. More realistic analysis, including timing analysis, was conducted in the C++ CE implementation. As such, the SNR profile used in MATLAB-based testing was a simple slow-fading channel. A plot of the SNR profile is shown in Figure \ref{fig:matlabSNRProf}.

\par While there are six different fitness score weightings (as shown in Table \ref{table:fitMissions}), the flight tests conducted in \cite{tim_implementation} focused on Emergency, Cooperation and Power Saving. Because of this, these were the missions that the MATLAB simulation focused on as well. Figure \ref{res:matSimFitscore} shows how the fitness score evolved over time during the simulation.

\par A few things are evident with the time series plots shown in \ref{res:matSimFitscore}. The first is that the spurs that are periodically showing up are the CE exploring random actions, and are spaced in a manner independent of training type. In addition, it is apparent that some mission types have different ranges of fitness scores that are possible within the action space, as the cooperation simulation has explorations that have a wider range of values than either the emergency simulation or the power saving simulation. Beyond this, it is evident that LM has a more difficult time than the other two training algorithms in adapting to the higher SNR portions of the simulated pass in both the cooperation and powersaving mission cases. Beyond this, it's fairly difficult to draw conclusions from these time series plots.

\label{res:matSimBinMean}
\end{figure}
\par In order to get a better understanding of the behavior of the different modifications of the CE, fitness scores were split into bins based on the EsNo at the moment that the fitness was observed. Once this was done, the mean was taken within each bin. This plot is shown in Figure \ref{res:matSimBinMean}. For the Emergency mission, LM and NSE proved to have similar average fitness scores, with RLM having lower average fitness scores. The cooperation mission was more ambiguous, with RLM and NSE performing better than LM in the higher EsNo regime, and performing worse than LM in the middle EsNo regime. Finally, the power saving mission shows both LM and RLM working markedly better than LM in the entire regime.
\par With the results shown in this section, there was enough motivation to progress from the MATLAB simulation to simulation, ground testing, and flight testing in C++.

\section{Simulation results, C++}
\par Simulations using the C++ implementation of the CE served two main purposes. The first purpose of C++ simulations was to verify the correct operation of the code. The second purpose is to provide a completely identical EsNo profile with which to compare the different training algorithms. As much as the NASA flight staff intended to use useful and consistent metrics when evaluating the quality of the communications channel during the window of opportunity when the ISS can be communicated with, the variation of conditions within each quality category resulted in the different tests conducted between 2017 and 2018 having pass qualities that were \textit{fairly\textbf{[this word is probably too vague]}} different from each other, making them harder to directly compare. Running a simulation allows for more direct comparison, albeit without the possibility of shifting the action space in a way that breaks the communication link.
\par The SNR profiles used in the C++ simulation come from attenuation profiles that were measured by NASA employees at GRC. These profiles are used with variable attenuators to simulate channel conditions. By subtracting these values from the maximum EsNo that the CE is expected to see, the attenuation. These values were fed to the CE. One example pass is shown in Figure \ref{result:cSimSNRProfile}, while the rest can be found in Appendix \ref{app:cSNRProfiles_all}.
