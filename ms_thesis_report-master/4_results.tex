\section{Weight choices}

\section{Simulation results, MATLAB}
\par MATLAB was initially used in developing the modified CEs, both with the RLM training method and the NSE training method. As such, the SNR profile that was used in testing was a simple slow-fading channel. A plot of the SNR profile is shown in Figure \ref{fig:matlabSNRProf}.

\par While there are six different fitness score weightings (as shown in Table \ref{table:fitMissions}), the flight tests conducted in \cite{tim_implementation} focused on Emergency, Cooperation and Power Saving. Because of this, these were the missions that the simulation focused on as well. Figure \ref{result:matSimFitscore} shows how the fitness score evolved over time during the simulation.

Explain what evaluation method we're using. \\
Then show results.
