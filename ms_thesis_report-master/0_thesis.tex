% This is a template for  Masters' Theses at WPI.
% It complies (more or less) to the standards given by the Library 
% (as of February 1999)
%
% Feel free to use this file, but I give no guarantee for its compliance
% to standards (meaning I won't pay for the paper if the library rejects it :))
%
%
% The lengths (textheight, width etc.) are fine-tuned for ps1, ps2, and ps3, 
% but seem to be somewhat dependent on the machine you are using to compile, 
% the date, time, moon phase, the weather, and other quantum effects.
% You may have to change \oddsidemargin a little, but it's about 98% correct.
%
% Also, the spacing is correct (doublespacing with footnotes correctly
% singlespaced). Curiously, the font size is not specified in the
% regulations. So feel free to change it, but the majority of theses
% that I have seen is written in 12 point font.
% 
% As for the inclusion of graphics, I recommend the methods specified
% in ``latexguide.ps'' off the CS-GSO Website. You can use other
% methods including copy and paste with a photocopier, but I think
% using the graphicx package is the easiest.
%
% Have fun and good luck with the thesis.

	\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
	 \par I would first like to thank Professor Alex M. Wyglinski for advising me throughout the entire process of this thesis, from providing me with the opportunity to work on this project to providing support and critique during the writing of this document. Without his guidance I would likely have had a much more circuitous path to completion of the thesis.  
	 \par This research was supported by contributions provided by NASA's John H. Glenn Research Center, as part of an extension of previous work. Special thanks to Richard Reinhart and Dale Mortensen for the expertise provided and administrative assistance provided, as well the rest of the SCaN testbed team who ensured that the testing was conducted as smoothly as possible.
	 \par Many thanks to Timothy Hackett from Penn State, the student who worked on the Cognitive Engine prior to me. He a major resource on the existing Cognitive Engine code base, as well as how to run the ground and flight tests. His assistance on the first days of ground testing and flight testing was very helpful. 
	 \par Finally, a thanks to Professor Sven Bilen of Penn State and Professor D. Richard Brown of WPI for being on my M.S. committee and providing feedback on this document.
