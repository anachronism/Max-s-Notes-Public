You should get back into writing in the journal, it may help. 

## What you want to do:
* Return to hanging out with more people, wider group than just Jona and Michael.
* Find more interesting places to take photos, you’re getting hella bored with around Harvard.
* Learn juicy Neo soul chords on piano. 
* Travel around Asia, Japan, Korea, China most likely.
    * HK, Chengdu, Taiwan (Taipei?), wherever Scott is, Tokyo, Seoul, etc. 
    * Probably want to see if anyone you know wants to do it. May be hard to get people though, as everyone’s working now.
    
## School related things:
* Do you want to get a PhD? 
    * Not really sure. Would I be doing it just to get it? I don’t really think so. Is the end goal management? I think that the answers to this question probably come down to what do I think is fulfilling in life. 
    * The general feeling I have at the moment is yes. I should probably talk to Evan about how he’s second guessing it. 
* Where do you want to be in 5 years?
    * Almost definitely not Boston probably. Honestly in the general area of any major city otherwise probably. Probably a city where people perform shows at lol. In the long term, I expect on the east coast, though I would like to at least visit the west coast a bit. 
    * New York, DC, Atlanta, Chicago, LA, San Diego, San Fran, Austin.
